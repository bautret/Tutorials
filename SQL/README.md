# SQL

From SQLZOO, we can learn the basics of performing SQL queries.

Here is the **[website](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial)** to review the exercises.
Here are my **[solutions](https://github.com/bautret/Tutorials/tree/main/SQL/SQLZOO)** *(I'd recommend to try by yourself first)*

## SELECT

###SELECT * <br />
###FROM table

1. You always want to start a **SQL QUERY** with **SELECT** then the symbol * means **ALL**.
2. You need to get the data from a **TABLE**.

### SELECT column_1, column_2 <br />
### FROM table

You don't have to select everything. You can choose the columns that are interesting to you.

### SELECT column_1, column_2 <br />
### FROM table <br />
### WHERE name = xxx

You can filter the data by using **WHERE** and add the sign **=**
- If it is a string, use brackets (e.g.: WHERE country = 'France').
- If it is an integer, you don't need to use brackets (e.g.: WHERE year = 1995).
