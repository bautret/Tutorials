# SQL

From SQLZOO, we can learn the basics of performing SQL queries.

Here is the **[website](https://].net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial)** to review the exercises.
Here are my **[solutions](https://github.com/bautret/Tutorials/tree/main/SQL/SQLZOO)** *(I'd recommend to try by yourself first)*

QUICK SUMMARY OF NOTIONS EXPLAINED BELOW

|FUNCTION  |
| ---------|
| SELECT   |

*to update at the very end + add a link to the notion*

## SELECT

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table
```

1. You always want to start a **SQL QUERY** with **SELECT** then the symbol * means **ALL**.
2. You need to get the data from a **TABLE**.

```sql
SELECT column_1,
  column_2
FROM table
```

You don't have to select everything. You can choose the columns that are interesting to you. Each column is separated by a comma, except the last one. You don't have to go to the following line for each new element, but it adds to readability.

```sql
SELECT column_1, 
  column_2
FROM table
WHERE name = xxx
```

You can filter the data by using **WHERE** and add the sign **=**
- If it is a string, use brackets (e.g.: WHERE country = 'France').
- If it is an integer, you don't need to use brackets (e.g.: WHERE year = 1995).

```sql
WHERE name IN ('Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark')
```

When you want to filter with several **INPUTS** you use **IN** followed by parentheses and a comma to differentiate each element.

```sql
WHERE number >= 2000
```
|Signs          | What for              |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| >             | Greater than          |
| >=            | Greater than or equal |
| <             | Less than             |
| >=            | Less than or equal    |

```sql
SELECT name,
  population/1000000
FROM world
```
You can divide/multiply a column by a number (if the column is containing integers)

```sql
SELECT name,
  GDP/population AS GDP_per_capita
FROM world
```
- You can divide/multiply a column by another column.
- You can rename a column by using **AS** and then the new_name.

```sql
SELECT name,
FROM world
WHERE name LIKE '%United%'
```
If you want to include part of a string in your filter, you can use **%**.

|% position     | What for                                |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| %text%        | Look if the string contains the text    |
| %text         | Look if the string starts with the text |
| text%         | Look if the string ends with the text   |

```sql
SELECT name,
  area
FROM world
WHERE area > 3000000 OR population > 250000000
```
You can use operators in your filter (WHERE).

|OPERATOR       | What for                                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| AND           | Need an addition of two or more elements      |
| OR            | Filter works with one or the other element(s) |     
| NOT           | Exclude certain element(s)                    |

```sql
SELECT name,
  population,
  area
FROM world
WHERE (area > 30000000 | population > 25000000) &
      (area < 30000000 & population < 25000000)
```
You can use several operators together.

```sql
WHERE year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2005
```
To specify a range (of dates, quantity etc.) you can use **BETWEEN** number_1 **AND** number_2.

```sql
SELECT name,
  year
FROM movie
ORDER BY year DESC
```
You can order the results in **ascending** (defaultor type **ASC**) and **descending** order (type **DESC**).

```sql
ORDER BY year DESC,
  name
```
You can add several levels of ordering by adding other columns (for name, it will order by ascending alphabetical order).

Important to have in mind the orders of execution.

|ORDER | CLAUSE   |
| -----| ---------|
| 1    | FROM     | 
| 2    | WHERE    |     
| 3    | GROUP BY |
| 4    | HAVING   |
| 5    | SELECT   |
| 6    | ORDER BY |
| 7    | LIMIT    |

```sql
ORDER BY subject IN ('economics','medicine'), subject,winner 
  name
```
You can decide to set a particular value from a column as **last**. In this case, it will sort results by subject first, then winner **BUT** economics **then** medicine as **last**.

```sql
SELECT continent, MIN(name) AS name
FROM world
```
You can select the **MIN** or **MAX** value. In case of a string it will use alphabetical orders, in case of an integer the minimum/maximum numbers. In this case you will get ALL continents, and the country names that appear first per continent.

```sql
SELECT SUM(population)
FROM world
```
You can use **SUM** to **SUM** the values of a column.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(name)
FROM world
```
You can use **COUNT** to **COUNT** the values of a column.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(Country)
FROM world
```
**DISTINCT** will remove the duplicates. In this case the country name will appear only once, without the distinct, it will retrieve all rows from the column Country.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
```
The **GROUP BY** is mandatory when you use an aggregate function such as **SUM** or **COUNT**.

```sql
SELECT OrderID, Quantity,
CASE
    WHEN Quantity > 30 THEN 'The quantity is greater than 30'
    WHEN Quantity = 30 THEN 'The quantity is 30'
    ELSE 'The quantity is under 30'
END AS QuantityText
FROM OrderDetails;
```

Using **CASE WHEN** allow you to categorize the values. 
The format is the following:

CASE
  WHEN condition1 THEN result 1
  WHEN condition2 THEN result 2
  ...
  ELSE result (not covered in the conditions)
END (you can use END AS nameofthecolumn)
  
## SELECT IN SELECT (subquery)

```sql
SELECT name FROM world
WHERE population > (
    SELECT population FROM world
    WHERE name='Russia')
```

This is a **SUBQUERY**. It means you will retrieve the **name** from the table **world** which have a **population** greater than the **population of Russia**.

```sql
SELECT name, continent
FROM world
WHERE continent IN(
      SELECT continent
      FROM world
      WHERE name = 'Argentina'
        OR name = 'Australia')
ORDER BY name
```

This is another example where you will get the **country names** and **continents** of the **countries** that are on the same **continent** than 'Argentina' **OR** 'Australia'.

## JOIN
There are several types of JOINs

| JOIN TYPE       | What does it return                                                      |
| ----------------| -------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| INNER JOIN      | Matching values in **both tables**                                       |
| LEFT JOIN       | **ALL left table** and the **matched records** from the **right** table  |
| RIGHT JOIN      | **ALL right table** and the **matched records** from the **left** table  |
| FULL OUTER JOIN | **ALL records** if there is a match in either left or right table        |

```sql
SELECT goal.player,
  goal.teamid,
  game.stadium,
  game.mdate
FROM goal
JOIN game ON (goal.matchid = game.id)
```

The aim of using **JOIN** is to find values in a table by linking another table on a **common column** (a key).

In your select you need to use **nameofthecolumn.nameofthetable**

In your **JOIN** you need to link the common columns.
JOIN table1 ON (table1.commoncolumn = table2.commoncolumn).

You can also simplify the code and make it shorter that way:

```sql
SELECT go.player,
  go.teamid,
  ga.stadium,
  ga.mdate
FROM goal go
JOIN game ga ON (goal.matchid = game.id)
```

After the name of the table you can use an **alias** to avoid (no need to use **AS** for this).

The expression "common columns" is not correct. We need to use **primary keys** and **foreign keys**.

| KEY              | Definition                                                                     |
| -----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PRIMARY KEY (PK) | Unique identifier for each record in a table                                   |
| FOREIGN KEY (FK) | Establish a relationship between tables by referencing the PK of another table |

In our example the primary key for the table game is the game.id and for goal is the goal.id (details of the table in the SQLZOO exercises).
